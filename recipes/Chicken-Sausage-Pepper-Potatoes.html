        <img src="../images/chicken-sausage-peppers-and-potatoes.png" alt="Chicken Sausage and potatoes">
        <p>Chicken, sausage, and peppers are roasted with Yukon Gold potatoes in a very hot oven until beautifully caramelized. 
        You'll need a large, heavy-duty roasting pan (or a couple of smaller ones) for this delicious dish.</p>
