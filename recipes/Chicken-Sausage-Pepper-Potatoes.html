        <h1>Chicken Sausage Pepper and Potatoes</h1>
        <img src="../images/chicken-sausage-peppers-and-potatoes.png" alt="Chicken Sausage and potatoes">
        <p>Chicken, sausage, and peppers are roasted with Yukon Gold potatoes in a very hot oven until beautifully caramelized. 
            You'll need a large, heavy-duty roasting pan (or a couple of smaller ones) for this delicious dish.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>4 large links hot Italian sausage</li> 
            <li>6 bone-in, skin on chicken thighs</li> 
            <li>½ pound assorted sweet peppers, seeded</li> 
            <li>4 large Yukon Gold potatoes, quartered</li> 
            <li>1 small red onion, sliced</li> 
            <li>½ medium yellow onion, sliced</li> 
            <li>2 teaspoons dried Italian herbs</li> 
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li> 
            <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li> 
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add sausage links and cook until browned and fat begins to render, 
                about 3 minutes per side. While they cook, lightly pierce sausages in several places with the tip of a sharp knife to 
                release fats and juices. Remove from the heat and place on a cutting board to cool slightly, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cut cooled sausages into 2-inch slices; return to the skillet along with any accumulated juices from the cutting board.</li>
            <li>Cut two slashes down to the bone on the skin side of each chicken thigh. Halve or quarter any large peppers.</li>
            <li>Place chicken and peppers into a large mixing bowl with onions, sausage and juices, Italian herbs, salt, and pepper. Drizzle with 
                remaining 1 tablespoon oil and mix with your hands until all ingredients are coated in oil, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer mixture to a large, heavy-duty roasting pan. Evenly space chicken thighs with the skin facing up and position potatoes near 
                the top.
            </li>
            <li>Roast in the preheated oven until chicken is cooked through and everything is caramelized, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer 
                inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Sprinkle with chopped fresh Italian parsley.</li>
