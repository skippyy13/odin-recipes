        <h1>Rosemary Chicken</h1>
        <img src="../images/chicken-rosemary.png" alt="Chicken Rosemary">
        <p>This is a good old rustic dish popular in rural Tuscany using the olive oil at harvest time and often made with rabbit in the same way. 
            Full of flavour, this simple dish is made with a few good-quality ingredients in just one large pan. 
            Use good-quality extra virgin olive oil as you will need quite a lot and the flavour is really enhanced by it! Excellent served with bruschetta.</p>

        INGREDIENTS
        1/4 Cup olive oil
        2 Lbs Chicken Thighs & Legs Bone In & Skin On
        Salt
        Pepper
        1 Tbsp Flour
        8-10 Clove garlic
        5-6 Sprigs Rosemary
        2 Chili Peppers (Red Pepper Flakes can be substituted)
        1/2 Cup White Wine
        
        INSTRUCTIONS
        In a large pan, heat the olive oil over medium high heat.
        Trim excess skin and fat from chicken. Use your palm to flatten out the chicken pieces for even cooking. Season generously with salt and pepper. Lightly dust with flour.
        Add chicken to hot oil, cooking for approximately two minutes per side, or until the chicken has a slight golden brown color. Turn heat down to medium.
        Smash the garlic cloves and slice the chili peppers in half. Place a few sprigs of rosemary, 2-3 garlic cloves, and half a chili pepper on each piece of chicken. Cover and cook for approximately twenty minutes, flipping the chicken pieces approximately half way through.
        Once the chicken is cooked through, add the white white to the pan and turn the heat back up to medium-high/high. Allow approximately two minutes for the white wine to reduce.
        Remove from the heat and serve.
