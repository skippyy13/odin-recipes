        <h1>Beef Beer Chili</h1>
        <img src="../images/chili.png" alt="Beef Beer Chili">
        <p>Using beer in chili adds incredible flavor to an underrated summer menu item. Bring a big ol' 
        thermos of this to a picnic or other warm-weather cookout, and it will make a great side to 
        those grilled burgers and dogs. Just have some insulated cups around — and maybe some hot sauce
        — and you'll be in business. But no matter what season it is, I hope you give this beef, bean, 
        and beer chili a try soon.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon beff fat
        <li>2 pounds beef mince</li> 
        <li>1 onion, diced</li> 
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li> 
        <li>3 tablespoons ground ancho chile powder</li> 
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li> 
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li> 
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li> 
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li> 
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li> 
        <li>1 (12 ounce) bottle beer</li> 
        <li>2 cups water, or as needed</li> 
        <li>1 cup tomato puree</li> 
        <li>1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried oregano</li> 
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</li> 
        <li>⅔ cup diced poblano pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>Place a large pot over high heat; drizzle in oil. Cook and stir ground beef, 
            onion, and salt in hot oil until beef is crumbly and browned and any released liquid evaporates, 
            about 4 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-high. Add chile powder, garlic, cumin, paprika, black pepper,
            and cinnamon. Cook and stir until mixture begins to darken, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in beer. Add water, tomato purée, cocoa powder, oregano, and cayenne; stir well. Bring to a simmer; 
            reduce heat to medium-low and cook for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in beans and poblano pepper. Simmer until peppers are tender and flavors have blended, about 30 minutes; 
            add more water if chili becomes too thick.</li>
        </ol>
