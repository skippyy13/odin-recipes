        <p>Using beer in chili adds incredible flavor to an underrated summer menu item. Bring a big ol' 
        thermos of this to a picnic or other warm-weather cookout, and it will make a great side to 
        those grilled burgers and dogs. Just have some insulated cups around — and maybe some hot sauce
        — and you'll be in business. But no matter what season it is, I hope you give this beef, bean, 
        and beer chili a try soon.</p>
